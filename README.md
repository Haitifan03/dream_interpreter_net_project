The dream interpreter website is designed to take a dream from the user, perform calculation, 
and then return an interpretation.
This project is designed for the entertainment of the user; We cannot actually interpret dreams.



Although this is not a serious project, it is designed using professional tools and clean code guidelines. 
The contributors are Samuel Gross and Mason Holland. Neither programmer, prior to this project, 
had experience in C#, .NET development, or SQL. Samuel (Haitifan03) is a graduate from Ball State University
and Mason (MJholland04) will be a graduate come May 25' from Taylor University.




These technologies are to some degree overkill for this project; 
There is no need for an SQL database, so a simpler project using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript would have sufficed.
This is a starter project in these technologies to gain experience and prove proficiency.




The project functions of this form:

Input: I had a dream I had a bowl of milk and cereal and was eating it on the couch 
when I looked outside and saw I was on an airplane.

Function: The dream will be scanned for keywords against an SQL table of interpretations, which it 
will return, appended to a random vague maxim from another SQL table (think fortune cookie).

Result: The milk represents your deep-seated insecurity about your skincare. Run with endurance 
the race set before you.
